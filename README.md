# pong

I wanted to introduce myself to game development using Python's pygame library. Had to rebuild pong given its reputation as the first commercially successful game. Took about an hour, and after some research I discovered that C++ is actually a lot better for game development! So off to C++ I go!


Here's a photo of the game window -- I couldn't be bothered to make it into an executable.
